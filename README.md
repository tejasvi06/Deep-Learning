### Run instructions
We ran the code using Visual Studio Code in local system.

1. To run the code offline, place the dataset named chest_xray in appropriate folder and open the ipynb file with VS code that has extensions of python, pylance and jupyter. Install all the required modules and then 'Run All' cells to execute the program.
2. To run the code offline using Jupyter notebook, place the dataset named chest_xray in appropriate folder. Open IDE (Anaconda) and go to jypyter notebook and install all the required modules. Then load the ipynb file and 'Rull All' for program execution.
3. To run the code online using Google Colab notebook, upload the ipynb file and dataset to colab and then 'Rull All' cells along with installations of required modules to start program execution.
